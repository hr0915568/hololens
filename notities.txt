Basic emulator input
Controlling the emulator is very similar to many common 3D video games. There are input options available using the keyboard, mouse, or Xbox controller. You control the emulator by directing the actions of a simulated user wearing a HoloLens. Your actions move that simulated user around and apps running in the emulator respond like they would on a real device.
